--* Choose the starting port and ending port that you would want to scan.
--* Click the submit button or press enter
--* Wait for the process to finish
--* The output will show in a list to the side
--* Clicking on a line in the list will bring up the respective information for that port, including its usage and vulnerability information.

## Supported Platforms
Any system running Python 3, specifically 3.6 will be able to run this program

## System requirements
--* Python 3
